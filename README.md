Based on the FreeCodeCamp django+vue tutorial

## RUNNING LOCALLY ##

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- NodeJS / npm
- Virtual environment (see next section)

### Set up virtual environment and Django stuff ###
- Start powershell
- Copy the requirements.txt to the djackets folder
- In the djackets folder, run this to make a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment by running "activate.ps1" in .venv/scripts/ 
- Run the following command to install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up Vue stuff ###
- Start powershell
- Activate the virtual environment by running "activate.ps1" in .venv/scripts/
- CD to djackets_vue/ and run the commands
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
npm install
```
(The first command installs vue/cli globally. The second installs the dependencies listed in packages.json inside the djackets_vue folder to djackets_vue/nodes_modules)

### Starting the Django server ###
- Start powershell
- Activate the virtual environment by running "activate.ps1" in .venv/scripts/ 
- Start the server by running "python manage.py runserver" in djackets_django/

### Starting the Vue server ###
- Start powershell again (new instance)
- Activate the virtual environment by running "activate.ps1" in .venv/scripts/
- Start the server running "npm run serve" in djackets_vue/
